### pow.cpp
Time Complexity - **O(log b)**   
`pow(a, b, c)` returns a^b mod c.
### gcdlcm.cpp
Time Complexity - **O(log(max(a, b)))**   
`gcd(a, b)` returns Greatest Common Divisor of a and b, `lcm(a, b)` returns Least Common Multiple of a and b.
### phi.cpp
Time Complexity - **O(sqrt(n))**   
`phi(n)` returns the number of integers between 1 and n that are coprimes to n.   
### isPrime.cpp
Time Complexity - **O(log^3 n)**   
`isPrime(n)` returns 1 if n is prime, or 0.  
### factorize.cpp
Time Complexity - **O(n^{1/4})**   
`factorize(n)` returns std::vector<unsigned long long> contains factorization of n.
